                    <p>GC Log Viewer is an online JVM gclog graphing tool. It is hoped that GC Log Viewer  
                        does away with the annoying situation of having to analyse a gclog file without 
                        any tools at hand. This is a first beta release of the application. The application  was written to:
                    <ul><li>See what could be done with SVG,</li>
                        <li>Use the indexedDB HTML 5 api,</li>
                        <li>Test out Angular JS in a real life application,</li>
                        <li>To see just how far HTML Applications have come 
                            and how far they still need to go. (Quite a bit.)</li>
                        <li>To better understand the GC Log output.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class='clearfix'>
                    <div class='how-to'>
                        <h2>How to use</h2>
                        A quick guide to GC Log Viewer.
                        <h4>Upload a log file</h4>
                        <p>GC Log Viewer is a client side application, meaning it runs entirely in your browser. To start using the application upload
                            your gclog file via the "Load File" menu item. The log entries are stored locally in an indexedDB object store. If your
                            log file is large you may be prompted to allow the database to exceed the default maximum size, which varies from browser to
                            browser.</p>
                        <p>The data will be persisted and available when need to analyze the data again. i.e you will not need to re-upload.</p>
                        <h4>Add Graph</h4>
                        <p>Once you have loaded your files graphs can be added to the display via the "Graph" menu item. You can load more than one graph at
                            a time. On Firefox you can drag and drop graphs to rearrange them. Currently drag and drop doesn't work in Chrome. There
                            is a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=168544">bug</a> related to this. Its been open for two years
                            so doesn't look like its going to be fixed soon. Could also be that the drag and drop HTML api is so bad its not worth using.
                            In a future release we may replace the drag and drop api with a custom implementation.</p>
                        <h4>Zoom</h4>
                        <p>On Chrome the SVG zoom functionality allows for zooming in on the generated graphs but the support or document is rudimentary making
                            it almost unusable. The "zoom" menu item is meant to make it easy to reset your zoom to a sane level once you get lost. </p>
                        <h4>Maintenance</h4>
                        Under the maintenance menu you can drop and create a new object store if you want to flush out all you data.

                    <div class='issues'>
                        <h2>Issues and Supported GCLog file formats</h2>
                        <p>The application has been tested with log files from a Java 8 JVM for the 
                        <ul><li>Serial,</li><li>CMS,</li><li>Parallel garbage collectors</li></ul>. Your mileage may
                            vary.In general the engineers who have created the JVM GC log file formats are deranged individuals who seem to care very little
                            about using a format that is easy to parse with any kind of tool. They prefer instead to wade through lines of text to find a 
                            problem it seems.</p>
                    <p>For the best results it is <b>recommended to turn on the -XX:+PrintGCDetails jvm option.</b> How far we succeeded in extracting 
                            useful information from the log files is hard to say. Any feedback on bugs and errors in the generated graphs will be appreciated.
                            If you have an issue also provide a snippet of the log file so we can see about improving the regular expression we use to extract
                            the data.  It is suspected that there will be a lot of log file formats in the wild will not be supported. Let us know.</p>
                    <h4>Future Plans</h2>
                    <p>Currently there the generated graphs are very rudimentary and future development will address this. We
                        hope to add indication of the pause time involved in each garbage collection at some point. The data is available
                        it is just a case of generating the necessary graphs.</p>
